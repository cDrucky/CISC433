01 In this project the students have to create various logic gates from simple NAND gates. This assignment allows students to play with the design of various gates and use simple gates to really understand how the logic design works. Forcing students to make complicated gates and Muxes out of a sequence of NAND gates forces students to think like a true computer architect and find the most effective way to create the gates. I believe that building the gates on paper through truth tables and boolean equations is the best way to start then creating the gates with their simple syntax. The debugger, if set up correctly, will show the user which step failed the test which allows a student to step through his gate and determine what the problem is. This tool works best if a person can also visualize the gate and draw the problems out to fix the issues they encounter.

This project would also find its place into a computer architecture course like our CISC 211. Using the gates that were created in the previous projects students will create basic adders for an ALU. Since the students created the complex gates with the NAND gates I would assume that the students will use the complex gates to make the project run smoother as long as they understand why the complex gates work with the NAND gates. Tracking the carry and sum using the gates is difficult with the simulator so I would recommend the students to visualize the gates with paper or some other tool.

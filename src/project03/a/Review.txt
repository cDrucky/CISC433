This project is the final building block for creating your own personal RAM unit. Using simple gates students will create the complex chips from simple flip-flop gates. These gates will show students how small gates "remember" out put and use that information in forward progression. This project would find a nice home in Discrete Math as well as a hardware course such as CISC 211.

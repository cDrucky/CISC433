This project deals with creating an assembler for you computer. This will allow your computer to utilize high level languages and break them down in Assembly langauge for the Hack computer. I have provided an assembler written in python by Scott King (all credit to him). This project would be perfect for Formal Language and Automata theory as it forces students to write a compiler essentially with a Lexical Analyzer and Parser.
